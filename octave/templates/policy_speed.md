The strategy to determine the speed of the robot movement is provided by the agent by generating the probabilities of selecting a given speed.

The maximum probability is an indicator of how much the agent generates deterministic behavior.

**The minimum value of the maximum probability is 0.11**.

It occurs when all speeds are equally probable.

1 / num of speeds = 1 / 9
