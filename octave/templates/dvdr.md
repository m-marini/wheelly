In the average-reward setting, the quality of a policy is defined as the average rate of reward, or simply average reward, while following that policy.

The differential reward is the difference between the reward and the average reward.

The estimation of differential reward is the difference between the differential value state of S(t+1) and the differential value state of S(t).

The real differential reward and the estimated differential reward are shown in the same chart for comparison.
