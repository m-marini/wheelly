The strategy to determine the change in direction of the robot is provided by the agent by generating the probabilities of selecting a given direction.

The maximum probability is an indicator of how much the agent generates deterministic behavior.

**The minimum value of the maximum probability is 0.042**.

It occurs when all directions are equally probable

1 / num of speeds = 1 / 24
