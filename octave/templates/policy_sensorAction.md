The strategy to determine the direction of the robot proxy sensor is provided by the agent by generating the probabilities of selecting a given direction.

The maximum probability is an indicator of how much the agent generates deterministic behavior.

**The minimum value of the maximum probability is 0.14**.

It occurs when all directions are equally probable.

1 / num of directions = 1 / 7
