In reinforcement learning, the purpose or goal of the agent is formalized in terms of a special signal, called the reward, passing from the environment to the agent.
At each time step, the reward is a simple number.
Informally, the agent's goal is to maximize the total amount of reward it receives. This means maximizing not immediate reward, but cumulative reward in the long run.
